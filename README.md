Exploring New Programming Languages
We've explored server-side programming with JavaScript, but there are many other options out there. In this assignment, we're going to take a look at working in Python.

There won't be a lot of information here on exactly what you should do. There are some pointers here to get you started, but you'll need to do a lot research on your own.

You should work through this assignment yourself, but check in with your group as you go to share what you are learning, useful resources, and ask questions.

Objectives
install tools required to work with a new language
explore basic syntax (variables, types, data structures, loops, conditionals, functions) of new language
solve a whiteboard logic problem in a new language
document and share what you've learned in a GitHub readme
Setup
MacOS already has a version of python installed. However it is likely a version of python 2 and the students will want to be working with python 3.

Homebrew Python Install
Install python version 3:

brew install python
If you get the following Error: Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /usr/local/Frameworks, it can be fixed by doing the following:

sudo mkdir /usr/local/Frameworks
sudo chown $USER /usr/local/Frameworks
If sudo isn't allowed, you can also try:

install -d -o $(whoami) -g admin /usr/local/Frameworks

Then,

brew reinstall python

Running
Homebrew sets up python 3 as a separate executable, which keeps it from conflicting with the MacOS version. That's awesome, but means instead of using python and pip you need to run python3 and pip3.

Pip is the package manager for Phython, like npm for Node.

Check that they both work:

python3 --version
pip3 --version
Hello World
A great place to get started with a new language is by making a Hello World program.

Search the web for a basic Hello World tutorial for your assigned language to get things started.

Basic syntax
Hello World is a great starting point, but you'll need to sort out more language features to get a bigger application up and running. Find a language guide to help you with basic syntax for functions, conditionals, and loops.

Take some time to look into how to buff it up a bit by writing a function. Can you get it to say hello to a person by name using a function parameter?

Programming
Here is a list of things you should focus on:

Variables & types :

how to make a variable (do variables have types?)
write to the console
Data structures and loops:

arrays or lists of things
objects
Functions and conditionals:

write a function that takes arguments and returns a value (sum 2 numbers)
operators - math, logical (and/or/not)
Pull things all together in one problem. Solve a whiteboard problem! (FizzBuzz, reverse a string or array, LeapYear, etc.) You can find our old whiteboard challenges in the syllabus repository!

Put it together
After you are a bit familiar with the basic syntax, solve one of our "whiteboard" problems (FizzBuzz, reverse a string or array, LeapYear, etc.) in your new language! Do this on your computer, not on a whiteboard!

GitHub Repo
Setup a new GitHub repo with a README file that has instruction for installing the new language tools & resources your group found useful. Then add some notes with an example of each of the items listed above. Think of this Readme as a way to highlight your new language learning journey. This is a great way to show potential employers that you can tackle a challenge and learn a new language quickly!

When you are done, complete the assignment on the portal with your GitHub repo link.
